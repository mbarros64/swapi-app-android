# swapi-app-android

This sample app has been developed with Kotlin following an MVVM architecture pattern with a modular approach using a public star wars api (https://swapi.dev/).

**Tools** 

*Koin for dependency injection*

*Reactive Streams for network*

*LiveData and ViewModel to isolate logic and maintain state*
